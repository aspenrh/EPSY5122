I knew at some point I would need to somehow get the data from the raw file into the new file, but I wasn't sure how to do that at first. after quite a bit of trial and error (and some very helpful resources such as stack overflow, geeks for geeks, and others), I figured out a rough outline of what I wanted to do! I found that making an outline for my code, the same way that you would make an outline for an essay, really helped me organize my thoughts\n",
    "### weirdly, I ran into a lot of trouble getting my timestamp column to work. honestly, it was just a tonnnn of trial and error before I finally did something and realized oh! it worked! cool! I think what I was doing wrong at first was I was basically trying to just directly copy the timestamp column from the raw file, not realizing that this list would be wayyyy longer than the others because every single event had a timestamp\n",
    "### the next big problem I ran into was I had a really hard time figuring out how to grab the data from the columns in the raw file. I kept getting weird key errors that didn't make any sense to me :( so finally, I decided to try making variables for the columns, and that worked! python is weird.\n",
    "### when I finally filled in my lists with all the data I needed, I noticed not all the lists were the same length, which was super confusing and frustrating to me. so I went into the raw csv and looked closely and it turned out that the first and last value of the left and right prob columns weren't supposed to be there, so I just deleted them, easy peasy\n",
    "### next, I'd like to try to adapt this to read in any csv file and grab the data in the same way and send them to a new csv file. also, I want to try grabbing the x and y coordinate data, since this relates to the project I'm working on. although it seems reallllly complitcated, so we'll see if I figure it out\n",
