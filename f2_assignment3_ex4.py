# Assignment 3 exercise 4

word = "banana"
word.count("a")
print(word.count("a"))

# mistakes!!!!
# I originally tried writing word.count(a), which didn't work
# I then realized I needed to put quotation marks around the a
# also, I forgot at first to include the print function in my code so Pthon would spit out the answer
